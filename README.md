# PROJ_01-image-encryption

Image Encryption with RSA Algorithm aims to encrypt confidential images using RSA algorithm and makes it intelligible to view without decrypting it.


Description:

-   The function reads the passed image which has to be encrypted. It picks up each pixel value of the image and stores it.
-   The encrypted image is created by encrypting each pixel value using the public key and the image is displayed.
-   The output image will be intelligile.
-   In the same manner, the encrypted image is read and each pixel value is picked up.
-   The decrypted image is formed by decrypting each pixel value using the private key and the image is displayed.
-   The original image is retrieved back.
